    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Web Cryptography API describes a JavaScript API for basic cryptographic operations, including: hashing, signature generation and verification, encryption and decryption.  Additionally, it describes an API for applications to generate and/or manage the keying material necessary to perform these operations.  This document presents use cases in the form of scenarios, with each scenario describing a potential web application using the API.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="requirements" class="section">
    <h2>2. Requirements</h2>
    <p>This section presents required features of the Web Cryptography API; in many cases, the Web Cryptography API encompasses more than one algorithm and more than one mechanism to accomplish each of these features.  The section presents code names for each of the features.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><dfn id="hash">HASH</dfn>, the ability to perform a cryptographic hash, where an algorithm that takes an arbitrary block of data returns a fixed-size bit sequence, called the <dfn id="hash-value">hash value</dfn>, such that any change to the block of data changes the hash value.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="mac">MAC</dfn>, the ability to generate a <em>message authentication code</em>, using an algorithm</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="sign">SIGN</dfn>, the ability to digitally sign a document, such that upon verification of the signature, the document's authenticity can be determined.  The term document in this context can refer to any kind of data used in web applications.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="verify">VERIFY</dfn>, the ability to verify a digitally signed document, as well as verify a MAC.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="encrypt">ENCRYPT</dfn>, the ability to encode a document using an encryption algorithm.  <dfn id="encrypt-pki">ENCRYPT-PKI</dfn> is a specific type of encryption involving PKI, and <dfn id="encrypt-sym">ENCRYPT-SYM</dfn> is a specific type of encryption using symmetric keys.</p></li> 
      <li><p><dfn id="decrypt">DECRYPT</dfn>, the ability to decrypt a digitally signed document.  <dfn id="decrypt-pki">DECRYPT-PKI</dfn> is a specific type of decryption using PKI, and <dfn id="decrypt-sym">DECRYPT-SYM</dfn> is a specific type of decryption using symmetric keys.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="derive">DERIVE</dfn>, the ability to derive a key or keys used in cryptographic operations; <dfn id="derive-pki">DERIVE-PKI</dfn> is the ability to derive keys usable in PKI operations.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="keyexchange">KEYEX</dfn>, the ability for two entities to exchange key(s) without interception by a third party, with <dfn id="keyex-dh">KEYEX-DH</dfn> representing Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a particularly common application of safe key exchange.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="keycall">KEYCALL</dfn>, the ability to call a particular key from a web application that either generated the key or that is in the same domain as the key.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="PKI">-PKI</dfn>, an acronym for <dfn id="pki">Public Key Infrastructure</dfn> used in this document as a suffix to other features.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="SYM">-SYM</dfn>, an acronym for <dfn id="sym">Symmetric Key</dfn> operations, used in this document as a suffix to other features.</p></li>
      <li><p><dfn id="random">RANDOM</dfn>, the ability to generate a random cryptographically secure number.</p></li>

      <h2>3. Use Case Scenarios</h2>
      <p>This section collates use case scenarios based on the requirements.</p>
      <div id="banking-korea" class="section">
      <h3>3.1. Banking Transactions</h3>
      <p>Park Jae-sang opens up a bank account with Gangnam Bank (GB), and wishes to log-in and engage in online transactions, including account balance checking, online payments (with some automated scheduled payments), and account transfers between domestic and investment accounts.  The first time Park logs in to the GB website with a temporary verification code sent to his cell phone, the bank asks him to ascertain if the browser he is using is not at a kiosk; moreover, he is asked if it is a web browser and machine configuration he will use often.</p>
      <p>He confirms that it is.  The GB web site then asks him to generate a public key/private key pair, along with a digital certificate.  Park consents, and the web page creates the key pair, storing his private key in the browser's designated key store, along with a one-time key escrow by the bank. [<a href="#derive">DERIVE</a> | <a href="#keyex-dh">KEYEX-DH</a>].</p>
      <p>Subsequent access to the GB website is triggered via presentation of the key that Park generated when he first accessed the website [<a href="#keycall">KEYCALL</a> | <a href="#decrypt-pki">DECRYPT-PKI</a> | <a href="#sign">??SIGN</a>].  His browser presents this key every time he accesses the website and enters his password, which effectively binds his username and password to the generated private key and certificate.  Additionally, Park can digitally sign online checks, authorize payments, and sign tax forms that he submits to the bank site using this generated key [<a href="#sign">SIGN</a>]. Park can also perform the following tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Park can receive documents from GB that only he can read.  These include his private bank statements and tax documents. [<a href="#decrypt-pki">DECRYPT-PKI</a> | <a href="#decrypt">DECRYPT</a>]</p></li>
        <li><p>Park can submit documents to GB that only GB can read, with the assurance that these have come from Park.  Such documents include confidential financial information. [<a href="#encrypt-pki">ENCRYPT-PKI</a>]</p></li> 
      </ol>

      <h3>3.2. Dr. What: Video Service</h3>
      <p>Virginie connects to her favorite video service to watch an episode of a show she is interested in using her entertainment device, which connects to the biggest screen in her living room.  The video service collects a monthly subscription fee and allows the watching of five streaming movies a month at that fee, and streams high definition content over an Internet connection.  Virginie does the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>She sets her device up to interact with the service.  During this process, the entertainment device generates the keys it will use and exchanges them safely with the video service [<a href="#derive">DERIVE</a> | <a href="#derive-pki">DERIVE-PKI</a> | <a href="#keys-dh">KEYEX-DH</a>].</p></li>
        <li><p>Subsequent access to the video service from her device is seamless, and it identifies her as Virginie, loading her preferences and her watch queue. [<a href="#keycall">KEYCALL</a> | <a href="#decrypt-pki">DECRYPT-PKI</a> | <a href="#sign">??SIGN</a>].  She can access the service and browse videos to watch.</p></li> 
        <li><p>She selects her favorite show -- Dr. What -- and picks an episode that she has not yet seen.  The service then determines that she is authorized to watch that video, and streams that video. [???] </p></li>
        <li><p>Virginie rates the video so that the service understands her preferences.  Along with personalized data about Virginie, the device sends usage statistics and metrics back to the service [<a href="#mac">MAC</a> | <a href="#encrypt-sym">ENCRYPT-SYM</a> | <a href="#encrypt-pki">ENCRYPT-PKI</a>].</p></li>

    <p>Mark wishes to post pictures of Mitch's 21st birthday party to a social network that allows confidential communication between members, but wishes to ensure that these pictures are safe from prying eyes.  He only wants Mitch to be able to view these pictures.  Mark can do the following: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>He can encrypt the photos with a key he generates for the occasion. [DERIVE | ENCRYPT]</p></li>
      <li><p>He can communicate with others on the network about the key and share the encrypted photos. [KEYEX | ENCRYPT-PKI] ?? WRAPPED KEYS ??</p></li>
